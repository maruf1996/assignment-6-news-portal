          <h1>What is difference between var, let and const in JavaScript?</h1>
          <p class="mt-4">
            A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a
            variable exists and what value it should start with. Similar to
            other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the
            declaration of variables. There are three keywords in JavaScript
            that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const. Each
            keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables
            they create can be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">let:</span>The let keyword declares a
            block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the
            block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces
            {}.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">var:</span>The var keyword declares a
            function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
            value. Function-scoped means that the variable is only available
            within the function it was declared in. Global variables are
            available throughout your entire code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">cons:</span>The const keyword declares a
            block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
            can't be reassigned. Constants are also called “immutable
            variables”, but that's a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
            variables - just ones that can't be reassigned.

          <h1>The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h1>
          <p>
            Arrow functions are a great feature added in ES6. ES6 was released
            in the year 2015. According to my own personal experience, I would
            prefer to use the arrow function every time I have the chance. This
            is due to the fact that the codes that use Arrow functions are clear
            and simple to read when compared with regular functions.
            Additionally, I am comfortable using the arrow function. When arrow
            functions are used in a way regular functions can't be completely
            replaced by Arrow functions. In some instances, which require
            regular functions. This means that arrows aren't the solution for
            all illnesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bolder">1. Syntax </span> The functions we define
            with the function keyword are referred to as regular functions.
            keyword function keywords are known as regular functions. Regular
            functions can be defined by two methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bolder">2. "this" keyword </span> This keyword is
            used in regular functions. It depends on the context of execution.
            Arrow functions are not like regular functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bolder">3. Using a new keyword </span> Regular
            functions that are created with function declarations, expressions,
            or both, can be called and constructed. Regular functions can be
            constructed; they can also be called with the new keyword. The arrow
            functions cannot be called and are not constructible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bolder">4. No duplicate named parameters </span>
            Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether
            in strict or non-strict mode. For regular functions, we can use
            duplicated named parameters in non-strict modes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bolder">5. Arguments binding </span> The Regular
            function can use Arguments keywords to access the arguments that
            were passed to it.

          <h1>.forEach(), .map(), .filter() .... What's the difference?</h1>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">.forEach() </span> Function .forEach() is
            another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate
            through array items. This case of a function is used for more
            complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a lot of
            entries than just an array of integers. This function takes 1
            parameter .forEach(callback). The parameter callback can take up to
            3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element parameter
            is required, the rest is optional).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">.map()</span>Function .map() is a manipulative
            function that can modify each element’s content in an array that it
            is called on. This function returns a new array with modified
            values, the array that it is called on will stay still. This
            function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing
            array, for example adding a property to an object or modifying it.
            Its construction and use are identical to the previous function
            .forEach() and both can be used interchangeably.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">.filter() </span> Function .filter() is a
            search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the
            assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example,
            that element is equal to a certain integer, or by more advanced
            terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property
            that is equal to something. Both examples have a very frequent use
            as a developer. This function returns an array of found results, if
            any, even if only 1 match is found. If a function does not find any
            match, it simply returns an empty array.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">.find() </span> Function .find() is also a
            search function like the previous but they differ in one small
            detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an
            array is more than one result, the function will return the first
            that has matched. Just like the function .forEach(), this function
            also takes only 1 parameter .find(callback). The parameter callback
            can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the
            element parameter is required, the rest is optional).

          <h1>Template strings</h1>
          <p>
            Template strings are supported by almost all browsers that are
            regularly maintained today. The only major one that doesn’t support
            it right out of the box is Internet Explorer. However, browsers that
            do not support it can add it with Babel. Node.js also supports it in
            version 4 or later. Template strings are the new standard for
            JavaScript strings. It is much better than strings before ES6 in
            that it supports interpolating expressions inside strings. We also
            have tagged templates which are just functions, with the decomposed
            parts of the template string as parameters. The constant string in
            the first parameter is the string in a decomposed array form, and
            the evaluated versions of the expressions in the order they appeared
            in the string are the remaining arguments. Tagged template functions
            can return any variable type.
